                        of Oxford's Department of Physics. Under the guidance of Dr. Caroline Terquem, I attended 
                        weekly 2.5-hour lectures that delved into a diverse range of physics topics. The program, 
                        designed to prepare students for university-level studies, provided a rigorous and intellectually 
                        stimulating environment. One particularly memorable lecture focused on quantum computing, where 
                        I was captivated by the intricacies of leveraging superposition, a quantum phenomenon, to create 
                        qubits. This experience not only deepened my understanding of advanced physics concepts but also 
                        laid a solid foundation for my academic journey.

                        I was awarded a one-week scholarship to attend the Technology & Engineering course at Oxford Scholastica 
                        during the 2020 lockdown. Throughout the program, I immersed myself in the physics of engineering towers 
                        and bridges, gaining a comprehensive understanding of their design principles. A highlight of the course 
                        was a collaborative project where I worked with a diverse international team to build HTML websites. This 
                        experience not only honed my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of effective teamwork in 
                        a virtual setting. Presenting our collective work enhanced my communication skills and provided valuable 
                        insights into the global nature of technological collaboration. Overall, the course at Oxford Scholastica 
                        significantly enriched my knowledge and skills in technology and engineering.
